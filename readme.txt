Sorry I submitted late. If you do not accept my late submission, could you just take the score from the submissions that I made before midnight?

I tried to pass more test cases because 1 of the campuswire posts said that the deduction of 5% happens at the end of the hour

I saw the discussions on campuswire about how to pass some of the remaining cases last minute


I'm not sure what other test cases I missed. There may have been a fibonacci one but I didn't have time to fix it. Thanks



Thanks
